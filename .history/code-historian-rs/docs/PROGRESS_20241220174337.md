- Memory usage: ~50MB base, ~200MB peak
- Visualization generation: ~2 seconds
- Plugin execution: ~50ms/plugin

### Targets
- Repository processing: 500+ commits/second
- Memory usage: ~30MB base, ~100MB peak
- Visualization generation: <1 second
- Plugin execution: <10ms/plugin

## Quality Metrics

    title "Code Quality Metrics"
    x-axis ["Test Coverage", "Doc Coverage", "Code Review", "Performance"]
    y-axis 0 --> 100
    bar [80, 70, 90, 75]
```

## Resource Allocation

```mermaid
pie title "Development Focus"
    "Core Features" : 40
    "Performance" : 25
    "Documentation" : 20
    "Testing" : 15
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority
- Performance optimization for large repositories
- ML model accuracy improvements
- Plugin system stability

### Medium Priority
- Documentation completeness
- User interface refinements
- Cross-platform testing

### Low Priority
- Additional visualization types
- Minor feature enhancements
- Code style consistency
